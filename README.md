#  BullyTrackerWebApp

Bully Tracker is a project designed to monitor and detect bullying in schools, using smart watches to provide real-time alerts to school staff. The project consists of two components: a web app for school administrators to manage the system and monitor students, and an apple watch app for students to use if they are in danger.
###
The web app is developed with Python, Flask, and Firebase. The Apple Watch App, developed in Swift, leverages various features of the Apple Watch and Swift including the Fall Detection API, HealthKit, and Core Location.

This repository is for the web app.
